DiabetesPrediction

Description : 

Diabetes prediction involves using data-driven techniques to estimate the likelihood of an individual developing or having diabetes based on various health indicators. The primary goal is to support early diagnosis and preventive care by analyzing patient information such as glucose levels, BMI, age, blood pressure, insulin levels, and family history.

By applying machine learning algorithms, patterns and relationships in the data can be identified to classify whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic. The predictions are typically made using classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or advanced techniques such as neural networks.

Technical Requirements:

a. Programming Language:- Python (preferred for data science and machine learning tasks)

b. Libraries/Frameworks:
- NumPy– for numerical operations  
- Pandas– for data manipulation and analysis  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn– for data visualization  
- Scikit-learn– for building and evaluating machine learning models   
- Flask / Streamlit– if deploying the model as a web app

Tools & Environments:

- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab / VS Code  
- Anaconda (for package and environment management)
